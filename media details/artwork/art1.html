                <p>This installation was made by Joseph Beuys in 1985. It is the third in a series of works that all have the same title and were produced in roughly the same way. It consists of thirty-one rough, bulky basalt rocks, which are scattered in a seemingly random matter. All the stones are a muted beige color and measure between one and two meters in length. It addresses themes of finality and death and ideas of regeneration. Beuys cut a conical hole in each slab and treated the ‘wound’ by lining the hollow with clay and felt. It represents potential for healing and renewal at the end of a violent century. It means that it is the end of the twentieth century, which was full of wars especially since WW1 and WW2 took place in the twentieth century.</p>
