                <p>This installation was made in 1991, it is the restored contents of a garden shed exploded by the British Army. The surviving pieces have been used to create an installation suspended from the ceiling as if held mid-explosion. The mundane and the refuge-like quality of the shed is important to the meaning of the work. She is taking the safe place of secrets and fantasy where a personal history of objects is no longer in use by exploding it. But she’s also created a new space in the process of creating an ‘exploded view’. The work is also about violence that exists around us in the world and the violence as part of the creative process.

                Cold dark matter is an unfathomable and immeasurable material in the universe. The title is connected between work and the world of science and space. </p>
