                <p>In Earth-65, Gwen Stacy, known as the Spider-Woman, struggled creating relationships which anyone around her, which made her felt isolated. Her friend, Peter Parker, was bullied and started experimenting with a dangerous chemical. He died in her arms at the night of the prom after she fought the lizard monster, who reverted to him. Her father found Gwenâ€™s secret identity thought that she killed and hunts Peter. At the present, Gwen fought a villain from another dimension, Vulture and she was saved by Spider-Man 2099, Miguel. She then joined his organization which is the Spider Society and teamed up with Jessica Drew who was another Spider-Woman to stop Vulture. Gwen's father cornered Gwen, but Miguel and Jessica stopped him. Months later, in Earth-1610, Miles Morales, as known as Spider-Man, fought a villain, which is The Spot. Miles was someone who was struggling to balance responsibilities and he experienced conflicts with his parents. He then met Gwen from another dimension, and they encountered The Spot again, who gained control over his powers. They chased him across dimensions, which revealed a larger organization of Spider-People and an algorithm that determined key events in each Spider-Person's universe. The algorithm predicted that Miles' father will die, and a conflict between Miles and Spider-Man 2099 about adhering to canon events. Miles escapes and returns to his universe to save his father while Gwen assembled a team to rescue Miles. Miles found a version of himself who has become the Prowler in Earth-42. Then, the story unfolded events in different dimensions and the struggle to maintain the "canon" events that hold the Spider-People's universes together.</p>
