                <p>Legendary explorer Indiana Jones hit a rough patch in his life after his son, Mutt died during the Vietnam War which broke him and Marion so bad that they were in the process of divorcing. After he was pushed into retirement, he was approached by Helena Shaw who needed help in taking the Archimedes Dial (an artifact that can alter time) away from the nazis so she can be a renowned archaeologist like him and her father. Jurgen Voller, a nazi and his men were after the Dial so they could undo the outcome of WWII so the nazis won the war. Indy and Helena traveled to various locations, and they eventually found both halves of the Dial.

                The nazis then catch up to the heroes, and Voller puts the two halves of the Dial together. The Dial unexpectedly transported Indy and Voller to the siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. Voller and his henchmen Klaber died when the soldiers shot their plane down. Indy and Helena then met Archimedes himself who intended for the Dial to be used to return him back to that era.  Indy wanted to stay there to be a part of history, but unfortunately Helena made him come back to their era which ended up with Indy reconciling with Marion, his ex-wife.
