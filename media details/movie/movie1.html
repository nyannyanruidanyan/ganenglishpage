                <p>It tells a story about a young boy named Asta, who did not have any magical powers while being in a world full of magic. He had a rival, Yuno. Who is a genius wizard that received the 4-leaf clover grimoire which brings good luck and is only received by an exceptional mage. Together, they fought strong enemies to prove their powers that they were worthy of being the Wizard King. For them to reach their goals, they must work hard. When the former Wizard King, Conrad Leto plotted the destruction of the Clover Kingdom, Asta and Yuno must face him. He was respected and loved by the citizens of the Clover Kingdom until he suddenly rebelled against his nation. He had the intention of trapping the souls of its citizens within the Sword of the First Wizard King to resurrect those he deemed worthy, which are the three former Wizard Kings, Edward Avalach√©, Princia Funnybunny, dan Jester Garandaros. If they are successfully resurrected, the Clover Kingdom will face a huge danger. Asta and Yuno must come up with ways to stop Conrad. They must rely on the strength of their friendship, perseverance, and fighting spirit to prevent the destruction of the Clover Kingdom.</p>
