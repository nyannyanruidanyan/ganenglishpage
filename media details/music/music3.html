                <p>Dark Red is a song released by Steve Lacy on February 20th, 2017. The title of the song, “Dark Red” represents the shade of a girl’s lipstick which represents confidence and the will to move on. On the first part, the person in this song saw that as a bad sign and thought that “something bad is about to happen” to him. He felt like something bad was going to happen to him and he tried to prepare for the worst. He wished that his beloved wouldn’t leave him. As stated in the second verse, he didn’t know why he felt like this. He was thinking about her so much that it made him lose his mind. He wished that she wouldn’t give him up on the chorus and said that he belonged with her only. On the bridge, he started seeing things from her perspective. He thought, “what if she’s fine?”. What if it’s just his paranoid thoughts that linger for far too long? What if the girl he loved wore the red lipstick for other reasons other than trying to move on from him? </p>
