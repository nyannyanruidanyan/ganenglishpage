                <p>Baby Hotline is a short song released by Jack Stauber on January 10th, 2019. The extended version of Baby Hotline along with Tea Errors was later released on March 21st, 2019. This song is the most famous and influential song to date, and overall is the most popular extended song. According to the most popular interpretation, it’s about someone trying to process the loss of a beloved one and some parts of the lyrics represent the dead person’s problems in life. On the first part of the lyrics, he wishes that she was a “hoarder of quarters”. He wishes that she collects coins so she could talk to him on the phone with those coins. He wishes that she could talk to him forever. The person must deal with a difficult situation where her eye “drinking eye has never opened”, which means that she was dead. She seemed like she had an addiction to drinking. The person may hint that he wanted to die with the girl he loved and to reunite with her to “see her okay”. The pills on that line might be antidepressant pills, since it’s implied that she is depressed. On the second part of the song, he realized that his attempts to connect with his dead beloved won’t work. It feels like he’s wasting all his energy and time just for a dead person. The person then visualized a sunbathe until the morning time, and to see her eyes wide open. Then, he immediately recognized that he was losing his mind. His final solution is to kill himself. He felt so good now that he’s dead.
