                <p>Overwhelmed is a song released by Royal & the Serpent on June 26th, 2020. The intent behind this song is to create a piece of art that depicts a shared experience that anyone can relate to. The inspiration for the beloved track came from Ryan Santiago’s experiences with mental health and struggles with sensory overload. In general, this song is about struggling with mental health and sensory overload, which is when the brain can’t process the five senses which leads to feeling “overwhelmed”. On the first part, the person felt confused why she felt so overwhelmed, the TV was “so loud” that she started feeling like her ears are bleeding. She couldn’t even look at the ceiling since it was too bright, and she felt like she was overheating. It was all too much for her to handle. On the chorus, she stated that she got overwhelmed so easily and that feeling of overstimulation could literally made her hard to breathe, as if she’s drowning. The second part of the song is about her struggles with keeping up with the crowd which made her overwhelmed. She feels like no one gets her and people say that she’s too sensitive because of her being overwhelmed easily. She was looking at the exits, which meant that she had a desire to get out of the overwhelming situation.</p>
