                <p>The band, Leo/Need realized they have actual fans and decided to move a step forward. The 2 fans happened to be siblings, Hanano and Yota who was having trouble with separating from each other since their parents are divorced which caused them to think about the past where they separated, especially Ichika who felt like she wanted to be there for someone but couldn’t. Ichika invited Hanano and Yota to their last performance to ease some of the pain those two were feeling since both must eventually separate. Leo/Need decided to come up with a song.  Ichika was struggling while writing the lyrics so she asked her bandmates for some ideas until Saki said something about fun memories that made her want to get better so she could see everyone (her childhood friends/bandmates) again. That gave Ichika an idea. Once she’s done, she showed the lyrics to her bandmates which made them remember their junior high school years. She was thinking of her bandmates when writing those lyrics. On the day of the performance, Ichika felt nervous, so she went to her SEKAI to meet Hatsune Miku to warm up. Outside the live house, Hanano and Yota met each other. Hanano thought that Yota wouldn’t come to the performance. Yota said to make the most of today. Backstage, the whole Leo/Need cast was looking for them until Honami saw them in the corner. Shiho thinks that they didn’t seem so happy. Ichika makes sure the song the whole band came up with can hit home with them and play better that day. Finally, the performance had begun, it was Leo/Need’s turn. At the first song, they played the song which was the first song Yota and Hanano heard around the time their parents decided to get divorced. Before the next song, Leo/Need’s vocalist and guitarist, Ichika explained that Leo/Need is a band consisting of childhood friends that used to deal with separation for almost two years. That’s why the song meant so much to them. All those memories of the two siblings were flooding back. After the performance, everyone saw the two siblings together. They were saying their goodbyes to each other, and Yota asked his sister, Hanano to see another show again sometime.</p>
