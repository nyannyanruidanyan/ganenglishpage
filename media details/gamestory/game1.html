                <p>On the day of the school festival, An invited Mizuki to the school festival. At school, Mizuki met An and her partner, Kohane who was from another school. They chatted for a little bit until Mizuki decided to “escape” from the situation and went inside the school. Inside the school, they heard a loud noise; it was three students in an empty classroom. Tsukasa was practicing proposing to Rui for a play called “Romeo Battle Royale” while Nene was watching. Before the play officially began, Mizuki met Akito and Toya. They watched the play together. The play was about a bunch of Romeos fighting each other for Juliet. After the play, Toya explained how one of the actors, Tsukasa was impressive and how he owes him everything since he’s the reason why he was able to be himself, which made Akito understand why Toya would look up to him even though he was considered weird. Later before the night festival, Mizuki was at the rooftop with their friend from junior high school, Rui. That moment reminded them of the time when they were lonely on the rooftop. Mizuki was glad that Rui was finally able to have that meant so much to him. Then, there were other people that came to the rooftop to find Mizuki. It felt like Mizuki wasn’t alone anymore and had people by their side, unlike how they felt in the past.</p>
