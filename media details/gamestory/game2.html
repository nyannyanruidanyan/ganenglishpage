                <p>A theater troupe, Wonderlands x Showtime were practicing for a play called “A Pianist Named Torpe”. During the practice, Rui pointed out that Tsukasa may have a hard time playing a role of Torpe, since Tsukasa and Thorpe are opposites. Rui considered not giving the role to Tsukasa, but he insisted. He wanted to give it a try because he may struggle, and he can’t just play the same types of characters repeatedly. So, the director, Rui reconsidered and help each actor grow to put on fun shows. The next day, Tsukasa struggles fitting the role and couldn’t understand how Torpe felt. Rui talked to Nene about Tsukasa’s unusualness when it comes to fitting the role. Rui felt bad that he only assigned Tsukasa to roles that fits him only, but Nene reminded him of what he told her and her past troupe, “You can look back all you want, but you can’t change the past”. Rui told Tsukasa to find the similarities between him and Torpe. When Tsukasa tried to think of the similarities, he couldn’t. But when he hung out with Toya in a café, Tsukasa remembered when his sister, Saki who, when she hospitalized during junior high school looked at the stars to lift her up, said a quote the character Torpe also said, “It’s always nice to look at the stars…”. Now that Tsukasa figured it out, he knew how to get in character. At the day of the performance, people that are close to him who watched the show didn’t expect Tsukasa to play that kind of character and the show went well. So, Tsukasa vowed to keep learning as much as he can to become a “true star”.</p>
