                <p>Olivia was a princess of a small country in Europe, except she enjoys doing what people normally do. She went to normal schools, and she could go out and play with other kids and just be herself. One day, she asked her dad to take her to a circus in town and she witnessed people trying to train a monkey. She tried confronting them and ran away to tell her dad and he dealt with them. One day, she met the twins which are Sophia and Ted. She had so much common with Ted. When she was 8, she started having those awful hiccups that became worse which made her become diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome. One time she struggled reading a poem due to her condition which made her ran away from class, but Ted reassured her to take what comes your way since nobody is perfect. So she never felt bad about herself again. One day, she set off on a cruise to reach a forest camping site. At the cruise, she accidentally showered at the wrong room and saw a guy named Mark, he helped Olivia packed her things to her things to her room. When the cruise reached a forest camping site, everyone split into pairs and Mark ended up being with Olivia. She talked about her love for animals, and he felt the same. After some time, she went to college and met him again, Mark was always around which made Ted irritated and jealous. Couple of days later, Ted asked Olivia with him to go to a big business awards ceremony. During the ceremony, she saw Mark and his brother getting the award for best leather supplier which made her mad. Ted explained that Mark’s family own a leather company using animal skins. She was mad at him, but her heart yearned for him. On the other hand, Ted tried to make her happy, but she was uninterested. Ted even proposed to her during the holiday in France, she felt so forced and had no choice but took the ring. Days later, she saw Mark at a Christmas celebration. Mark explained that he left the family company a long time ago, he was invited by Ted to go to a big business awards ceremony. When his brother won the award, he asked Mark to go up with him. Ted then saw her talking to Mark and Sophia confronted Ted. Sophia told Olivia that Ted only wanted to marry her just to be the next king and manipulated both Mark and Olivia. After that, Ted got kicked out from the palace and she and Mark ended up being together.</p>
