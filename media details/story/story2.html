                <p>Hana was the school news reporter. One day, her editor asked her to write an article on the most popular guy named Dante with extraordinary football skills and he was a massive bully. She wasn’t interested at first, but the editor insisted. Dante threw a game-winning touchdown and he celebrated with his teammates in the locker room. When she showed up to do an interview with Dante, she noticed that they were harassing the team mascot, Alvin. She stood up for him and tried to interview Dante, but he said that he’s going to host a party at his house. She joined the party anyways; she would do anything for Dante to answer her questions. Later, she approached Dante’s maid and was sorry for her, but the maid said that the job is easy and Dante does all the cleaning himself. On the next day, she looked for Dante for another interview attempt. She found him talking to Alvin, someone he and his teammate harassed. She was about to defend Alvin until she witnessed both shaking hands. Then she kept on stalking Dante. She watched him doing nice things, which was unexpected for her. He then caught her stalking him and explained that he apologized to Alvin. Hana then asked why he was keeping that nice side of him a secret, he refused to explain. She continued following him. A few hours later, she followed him to his parents’ house, and she lost balance which made his family caught her. Dante’s mother invited her on a dinner. Hana and Dante pretended to be friends there, and then she found out he was into cosplaying and writing his own story. Later, he explained that he hid his true self and made friends with the popular kids because his interests were too geeky. She realized she completely misjudged him. She later wrote an article about him and realized that she couldn’t make the article public, but she accidentally did it. People were making fun of him, which Dante didn’t show up at school for the next days. She then decided to write another article and tried to interview other students. She convinced the popular girl to convince other students to help on her interview. All of them pretended to be something they aren’t. At night, she tried so hard to write the article, people’s reactions were positive. Which made Dante at least came back to school. Weeks later before spring break, she opened her locker and found a comic book made by him. He was thankful for her, if it wasn’t for her, he would not show his true self. That experience made her realize that she shouldn’t judge a book by its cover</p>>
