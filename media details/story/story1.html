                <p>Michael Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer who was the most popular entertainer in the early and mid-1980. Michael Jackson was renowned as the "King of Pop: by 1984. He was the youngest and most talented out of the five brothers whom his father shaped into a group of child stars known as the Jackson 5. As Michael matured, the group finally broke with Motown, moving to Epic Records as the Jacksons. Jackson's first solo effort for Epic, Off the Wall (1979) passed all expectations and was the bestselling album of the year which sold more than 20 million copies. Three years later his album, Thriller, sold more than 40 million copies. It was the best-selling album in history. His reputation was damaged when he was accused of child molestation by a 13-year-old boy he had befriended; a civil suit was settled out of court. His image suffered more when he was arrested and charged with child molestation. Called to testify in Jackson’s defense during the trial that ensued was actor Macaulay Culkin, Culkin maintained that he had never experienced anything inappropriate with Jackson. After a 14-week trial, he was freed in 2005. During the events, he suffered a financial collapse. He was preparing for a series of high-profile concerts when he died suddenly of cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. In August 2009 the coroner announced that Jackson’s death a was homicide that was caused by lethal combination of sedatives and propofol, an anesthetic. Jackson’s personal physician was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in November 2011.</p>
