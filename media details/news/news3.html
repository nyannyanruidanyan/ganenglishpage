                <p>Mexico and Canada have replaced China as USAâ€™s top providers of goods. On an annual basis, China had ranked as the top provider of goods to the US for more than a decade with China reaching a peak last year. Bilateral trade is being challenged by the widening split of Beijing and Washington over issues such as human rights, fair trade and competition for technology and markets. However, as US consumers become selective in spending, demand for China-made products has been cooling. US imports from China in June has been the lowest since the immediate onset of the pandemic.</p>
